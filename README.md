# Personal Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Neovim configuration built with
[nvf](https://github.com/notashelf/nvf).

## Running

You can test it with:

```bash
nix run github:derethil/nvim-config
```

You might see requests to allow Cachix substituters (`derethil.cachix.org`)
during builds as I have set up a workflow to cache configuration builds on
Cachix.
